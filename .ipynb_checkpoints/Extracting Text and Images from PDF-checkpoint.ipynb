At least 19 per-\\nsons have been reported to be wounded, one of whom is said to be in a crit-\\nical state. A dozen of the injured have taken pellet hits, including in the\\nface. This is suggestive of the fact that pellet guns were fired from \\nclose range. \\nWhen scores were blinded or lost sight in one eye as a result of pellet\\ninjuries in the post-BurhanWani protests of 2016 in Kashir valley, the gov-\\nernment mulled minimising if not eliminating the use of pellet guns until\\nsuitable replacements were developed. The faulty trajectory of the dis-\\ncharge from close range from these weapons was hitting people in the face,\\nand head and chest areas, causing injuries of a grave nature. Such weapons\\nwere not proving to crowd deterrents in volatile situations but instruments\\nof possible death, which raised political costs for the local administration\\nand the country internationally. \\nClearly, no active thinking on ending the use of such weapons may exist\\nnow except on paper. Last year, not long after the ending of J&K’s consti-\\ntutional autonomy, the government forces in Srinagar had used pellet guns\\non a thick crowd of civilian protesters in the Soura-Anchar locality, a dirt\\npoor area of the old city. The incident, which caused widespread injury,\\nhad raised international concern, and gave the lie to the orchestrated gov-\\nernment propaganda that people had accepted the ending of autonomy\\npeacefully and had not protested.\\nLast Thursday the Supreme Court disallowed the holding of Muharram\\nprocessions anywhere in the country on the ground that this may lead to\\nthe blaming of a particular community (the Shia Muslim) for the spread of\\nthe new coronavirus (presumably as had happened in the case of the\\nTablighi Jamaat). If this was a common sense precaution the top court\\nsounded, the authorities in Kashmir enforced it with brutal energy. \\nOver the years, Muharram processions in Kashmir have been routinely\\nlimited to specified areas in order not to take chances with sectarian clash-\\nes, but last week’s violence testifies to the uncommon zeal that the govern-\\nment brought to the fighting of Covid-19 by cracking down with unqualified\\nforce on the small Muharram processions. This stood in sharp contrast\\nwith police behaviour at religious ceremonies of India’s majority commu-\\nnity in many parts of the country, sometimes held with official sanction\\nand display of devotion, underlining the grievance of many that the blatant\\nrepression of Kashmir and the taking away of J&K’s historical rights owes\\nto the fact of the Valley’s denominational status in contrast with the rest of\\nthe country.\\nThere is no peace in Kashmir, and the government’s fear of the people\\nseems real. Top political figures, no longer in detention, are routinely pre-\\nvented by the police from leaving their homes. Last week, a group of pro-\\ntesters of the People’s Democratic Party was scattered through police\\naction. This was immediately followed by the police attacks on Muharram\\nprocessions.
